### More Information

I have always questioned and wondered different forms of inequalities like gender inequality, socioeconomic status inequality, and other forms of inequalities. Since 1990s, I have been working to mitigate the different forms of inequalities aforementioned above. In addition to studying on the topics like social inequality, politics, economics, and philosophy in my free time, I play chess and candy crush.
